# Data Science Learning
Repository of code, resources and utilities related to different data science and machine learning topics. For learning, practicing and teaching purposes.

## Jupyter Notebooks
Many of the resources entries are personal Jupyter notebooks that contain a mix of textual explanations, references, comments and code examples about the discussed topic.

Notebook can be in different states and have different purposes, some are polished in content **[FINAL]**, with complete explanations, proper structure and -hopefully- working code. These I consider to have the potential to be useful to others for learning. Some have been started and worked on with the same goal, but are not yet finished **[WIP]**.
A third type of content is about notebooks where I simply play around with code for testing/practicing personal ideas **[DEV]**. While I often try to comment code snippets, these notebooks might have a more chaotic structure and miss properly cured discussions about the topic and techniques used.

### [FINAL]
* [Data Manipulation and Visualization with Pandas and Seaborn — A Practical Introduction](Pandas and Seaborn.ipynb)

### [WIP]
* [Statistics - Basic Theorems](statistics/Statistics - Basic Theorems.ipynb)

### [DEV]
* [Image Processing - Basics](image processing/Image Processing - Basics.ipynb)
